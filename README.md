# OOPS Learning Project 🚀

This repository is created to learn and practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts in Java** step by step, starting from basic console programs to more modular, scalable, and reusable designs.

## 📌 Project Overview
The project begins with simple Java programs and gradually evolves into a structured **OOPS Banner App**, applying core Java, OOPS principles, and clean coding practices.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Java Basics (Class, Main Method, Print Statements)
- Strings and String Manipulation
- Arrays and Loops
- Methods and Code Refactoring
- Object-Oriented Principles:
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Modularity
  - Reusability
  - DRY Principle
- Inner Classes
- Collections Framework (HashMap)
- StringBuilder for efficient string handling
- JavaDoc for documentation
- Git & GitHub workflow (branches, commits, merges)

## 🧩 Use Case Progression
- **UC1** – Print OOPS to console  
- **UC2** – Render OOPS as banner using print statements  
- **UC3** – Use `String.join()` for better efficiency  
- **UC4** – Use arrays and loops  
- **UC5** – Inline array initialization  
- **UC6** – Refactor banner logic into methods  
- **UC7** – Store character patterns in a class  
- **UC8** – Use Map for character pattern management  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Java
- Git & GitHub
- IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code (any Java IDE)

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository is meant for:
- Learning OOPS concepts practically
- Understanding how code evolves through refactoring
- Following professional Git branching practices
- Building a strong Java foundation for interviews and real projects

Happy Learning! 😊
